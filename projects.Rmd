Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [Data Visualization in R](http://nickstrayer.me/visualization_in_r/)

- An RMarkdown presentation on the common mistakes made in visualization and how to fix them.
- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
- Look at how high quality my work is, hire and or collaborate with me. 

## [Statistical Plots](http://bl.ocks.org/nstrayer/37a503dd1db369a8f7e3ce21757e19ee)

- Interactive plots of things
- I can code!
