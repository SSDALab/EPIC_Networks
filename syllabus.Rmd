# Course Description

<img src="figs/network.png" style="width:20%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left">

This course lays the groundwork of Social Network Analysis (SNA) from a *Conceptual*, mathematical and *Computational* perspective. SNA differs from other analytic perspectives in requirements for data collection, storage, descriptive, and statistical analysis. The course will address each of these by sampling from a range of the most commonly used classes of analytic concepts, demonstrating for each their implementation in primary data collection efforts and empirical analyses (in R).

We will address these concepts around two organizing principles: (1) the two primary theoretical frameworks capturing reasons networks “matter”; and (2) how each class of measures can be applied across different units of analysis: individuals, groups and “whole” networks. While by no means exhaustive, this course will provide students with the beginning toolkit for SNA. SNA is a rapidly advancing field, and these tools are intended to provide the orienting frameworks that can guide further study of SNA on your own.

## Prerequisites 
No formal statistical training or prior experience with R is assumed. However, students' prior familiarity with statistical and computing principles will enhance the course experience, easing the extension of coursework to your own research. Each course module's presentation will *Conceptual*ly build only from prior material covered in this course. Code templates will be provided for the measurement and computation of each of the introduced concepts. All slides, scripts and data will be posted to github ([https://ssdalab.github.io/EPIC_Networks/](https://ssdalab.github.io/EPIC_Networks/)). Participants should bring a computer for personal use (Windows, Mac or Linux), with R previously installed. We recommend going through the [Intro R Tutorial](https://ssdalab.github.io/IntroR/) before class starts. We will use a number of R packages, which will require that you have privileges on your machine that allow you to install programs/applications. All details about installation of R and RStudio can be found in  [Intro R Syllabus](https://ssdalab.github.io/IntroR/syllabus.html) and details on the necessary packages can be found in [Intro R: Tutorial 5](https://ssdalab.github.io/IntroR/Tutorial5.html) and [Intro R: Tutorial 6](https://ssdalab.github.io/IntroR/Tutorial6.html).

# Course Objectives

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
1. Understand the primary theoretical & analytic frameworks that underpin SNA.  
2. Grasp the primary strategies for gathering & storing social network data.  
3. Compute & interpret several primary classes of measures, for varying analytic levels.  
4. Describe some of the most commonly observed patterns in empirical networks  
5. Run descriptive & statistical analyses (in R) to identify these patterns in real data.
