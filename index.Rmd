# __Introduction To Social Network Analysis__

This course lays the groundwork of Social Network Analysis (SNA) from a *Conceptual*, mathematical and *Computational* perspective. SNA differs from other analytic perspectives in requirements for data collection, storage, descriptive, and statistical analysis. The course will address each of these by sampling from a range of the most commonly used classes of analytic concepts, demonstrating for each their implementation in primary data collection efforts and empirical analyses (in R).

We will address these concepts around two organizing principles: (1) the two primary theoretical frameworks capturing reasons networks “matter”; and (2) how each class of measures can be applied across different units of analysis: individuals, groups and “whole” networks. While by no means exhaustive, this course will provide students with the beginning toolkit for SNA. SNA is a rapidly advancing field, and these tools are intended to provide the orienting frameworks that can guide further study of SNA on your own.

**Before Class Starts**: I recommend reviewing the [Intro R Tutorial](https://ssdalab.github.io/IntroR/) for the course and make sure you can install R, RStudio and all the necessary packages.
