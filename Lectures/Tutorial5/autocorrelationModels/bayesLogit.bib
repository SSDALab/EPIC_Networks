	Abstract = {{Structural (or social) balance is regarded as a fundamental social
   process. It has been used to explain how the feelings, attitudes and
   beliefs, which the social actors have towards each other, promotes the
   formation of stable (but not necessarily conflict free) social groups.
   While balance theory has a rich and long history, it has lost favor in
   recent times. The empirical work has taken one of two forms. Most
   empirical work on social balance has focused on dyads and triples, and
   findings have been inconsistent. The remaining studies focus on the
   structure of the group as a whole. Results here have been inconsistent
   also. One major problem is that the first line of work is based only on
   the source ideas of Heider while the second has been based only on the
   ideas of Cartwright and Harary. Some of the inconsistencies may be due
   to this empirical split where the two streams of ideas do not inform
   each other. We propose a new theoretical model for social balance in
   the form of an agent-based simulation model. The results we present
   account for several of the inconsistencies found in the literature. The
   model simulates distinct but interdependent social actors making
   positive and negative selections of each other in efforts to reach
   balanced cognitive states. The design variables for the simulations are
   group size, degree of contentiousness of a group and the mode of
   communicating choices regarding the existence and sign of social ties.
   The group level balance mechanism used by the dynamic model is based on
   the idea of partition balance, as proposed by Doreian and Mrvar {[}Soc.
   Netw. 18 (1996) 149]. Actor selections, over time, generate networks
   that partition group members into stable, balanced subsets at
   equilibrium or near equilibrium. The design variables have complicated
   impacts on the number of actor choices made to reach balance, the level
   of group imbalance, the number of actors with balanced images and the
   number of plus-sets formed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

@article{benjamin09,
	Abstract = {{Bridges that span structural holes are often explained in terms of the
   entrepreneurial personalities or rational motivations of brokers, or
   structural processes that lead to the intersection of social foci. I
   argue that the existence and use of bridges in interpersonal networks
   also depends on individuals' health. Poor health may make it more
   difficult to withstand the pressures and to execute some of the common
   tasks associated with bridging(e.g., brokerage). I examine this
   possibility using egocentric network data on over 2500 older adults
   drawn from the recent National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
   (NSHAP). Multivariate regression analyses show that both cognitive and
   functional health are significantly positively associated with
   bridging, net of sociodemographic and life-course controls. The
   relationship between functional (kinesthetic) health and bridging
   appears to be partially mediated by network composition, as older
   adults who have poorer functional health also tend to have networks
   that are richer in strong ties. Several potential mediation mechanisms
   are discussed. Cognitive function remains significantly associated with
   bridging net of network composition, Suggesting that the inherent
   challenges of maintaining bridging positions may be more difficult to
   cope with for those who have cognitive impairments than for those who
   have functional impairments such as limited mobility. An alternative
   explanation is that cognitively impaired individuals have more
   difficulty recognizing (and thus strategically using) bridges in their
   networks. Theoretical implications and possibilities for future
   research are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
